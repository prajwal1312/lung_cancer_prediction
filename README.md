Lung Cancer Prediction Using CNN 🧠🩻


This project implements a deep learning-based system for the prediction and classification of lung cancer types using image data. The goal is to help in the early detection and accurate categorization of lung cancer, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.

📌 Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. This project leverages deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to distinguish between various types of non-small cell lung cancers such as:

Adenocarcinoma

Squamous cell carcinoma

Normal tissue

The model aims to achieve high accuracy in classification by training on labeled lung scan images.

💡 Features
Automated classification of lung cancer images

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

High prediction accuracy

Scalable and modular codebase

📁 Dataset
The model was trained on a public lung cancer image dataset, which includes:

Normal lung tissues

Adenocarcinoma images

Squamous cell carcinoma images

🧠 Technologies Used
